            <p>brief into as in the footer</p>
		<p>The Circus Magazine is a project developed for the final exam of <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2021/454464">Information Modelling and Web Technologies</a> course within the <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge">DHDK Master's Degree</a>, Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna, a.y. 2020/2021.</p>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<p>The project started with a team call to establish the steps and having a first brainstorming on the Journal topic core.</p>
		<p>After a brief discussion, we went for a wide reference to the “Circus” because it is a suitable topic to be seen by several points of view (historical, social, medical, animal welfare related, artistic representations, and so on) as well as suitable to be treated in different visual layouts.</p>
		<p>Then we started to search the 9 articles (3 each of the three issues) strongly related within the same issue and at least quite related between the issues.</p>
		<p>In order to have to deal with cross reference also between languages, we planned to have a multilingual editorial plan with, for each issue, a main article and a book review in English, and a guest article in a different language - respectively Spanish, French and Italian. The "main" and the "guest" articles presents different visual features to be managed such as color or b/w photos or images, tables, boxes and special layout and so on. The "book review" article presents an easier layout.</p>
		<p>In terms of licences, we deliberately search for only open access contents with a maximum closure of CC-BY-SA-NC in order to be able to either give to the final user complete access to the original version and be allowed to do our project (avoiding then the ND not derivate clause).</p>

	<h2>pre-1800</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: OTTAVIANO PETRUCCI and Early printings</h3>
	<p>For the ante quem 1800 style of our <em>Circus Magazine</em>, we decided to get inspired by the clean, elegant and essential graphics of some early examples of printed music in 16th-17th centuries. Mainly, we took as reference the work of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottaviano_Petrucci">Ottaviano Petrucci</a> (1466-1539), but also considered coeval printed books – e.g. by Aldo Manuzio – and traditional practices in the writing and printing of music around that time.</p>
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>The retrieval of a suitable font which could be at the same time readable as well as resembling the typography of 16th century was not easy. The choice fell on the <em>IM Fell Great Primer</em> font by <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/im-fell-great-primer-font.html">Igino Marini</a> which was used in both its normal as well as all its all capitals version (<em>IM Fell Great Primer SC</em>), as to simulate their combination and or alternation in early printed books for headings, authors, prose and poetry.</p>
	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	<p>As for it is for early printed books of music by Ottaviano Petrucci, such as the <em>Harmonice Musices Odhecaton</em> (ca. 1501), we limited our choice to a dark brown colour for ink-ish texts over the background image – set to the <code style="display: inline;">&lt;body&gt;</code> element as to resemble a unique sheet of paper. The only other colours present are a blue taken from one example of Petrucci’s printings for decorated initials and the dark red, inspired by ancient book’s rubricae and by ancient sacred music – where musical notes where black over the four red lines staves.</p>
	<h3>LAYOUT and DETAILS</h3>
	<p>We decided to express as much as possible the essentiality and wide use of negative/white space, thus developing a quite simple and clean layout. For the Bibliographic References’ section, we customized the dotted list style by means of the rendered screenshot of a note in squared notation from the Odhecaton’s digitalization available at <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Harmonice_Musices_Odhecaton_(Petrucci,_Ottaviano)" title="Odhecaton - IMSLP">IMSLP</a>.</p>

	<h2>1950-1989</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: SAUL BASS</h3>
	<p>As representative for the cultural period 1950-1989, we decided to adopt as theme the work and aesthetic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass">Saul Bass</a> (1920-1996), the graphic designer known for his title sequences and movie posters design. A strong characterization in font, a peculiar use of colours, essential, clean, creative and neat delineation of graphical areas could be of great inspiration and example for web as well as for graphical designers.</p>
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>At first, browsing on the web for fonts resembling the Saul Bass typography, we found the <em>Hitchcock</em> font by <a href="https://typographica.org/on-typography/saul-bass-website-and-hitchcock-font-are-back/">Matt Terich</a>: this seemed to be the perfect solution for our purposes, but unfortunately it had to be discarded due to its copyright policy. We then thought about the 1001 fonts’ <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/doublebass-font.html"><em>Double Bass</em> font</a>, but this had indeed issues with the encoding of numbers, which weren’t readable indeed. 
	Thus, the choice fell on <em>Bassanova</em> by <a href="https://textfonts.net/bassanova-font.html">Julia Bausenhardt</a>, which seemed to be quite accurate as well as the previous ones, if not more. 
	We combined, throughout the <em>Issue Viewer</em>, different font sizes, decorations – e.g. using font-variant-ligatures: discretionary-ligatures – and an assorted use of colours as to express variety and to break the flow of words with highlighted and engaging keywords, bibliographical references and emphasised words, in line with the bold aesthetic of Saul Bass.</p>
	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	<p>For what concerns colour, the philosophy of Saul Bass seems to be quite straightforward: not many colours (generally 3 or 4 maximum), but vivid and striking. For our <em>Circus Magazine</em> theme, we decided to resemble as much as possible this ethos, but, of course, taking into consideration also the many layers of content available in the <em>Issue Viewer</em>. For these reasons we created a palette of the following colours and assigned them based on Saul Bass iconic title sequences or movie posters or on the semantics of our webpage – e.g. minor headings being lighter nuances of the intense colour of the major heading.</p>
	<h3>THE SKEW PROPERTY and DETAILS</h3>
	<p>In order to express the dynamic combination of areas of colours that intersect and overlay with plenty of diagonal lines instead of standards square angles, we decided to play with some content containers, such as the <code style="display: inline;">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements of the sections of the articles or the headings. By means of the css skew property, we applied a skew rotation to those elements on which this would not have resulted in a diminished readability for the web user. Some examples are the articles’s main headings, the section titles, the bibliographic references section. For this very last portion of the articles, the dotted list style was customized by means of the creation of an image from the star character with <em>Double Bass</em> font.</p>
