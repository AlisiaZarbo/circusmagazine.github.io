            <h2>THE CIRCUS MAGAZINE</h2>
            <p>brief into as in the footer</p>
		<p>The Circus Magazine is a project developed for the final exam of <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2021/454464">Information Modelling and Web Technologies</a> course within the <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge">DHDK Master's Degree</a>, Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna, a.y. 2020/2021.</p>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<p>The project started with a team call to establish the steps and having a first brainstorming on the Journal topic core.</p>
		<p>After a brief discussion, we went for a wide reference to the “Circus” because it is a suitable topic to be seen by several points of view (historical, social, medical, animal welfare related, artistic representations, and so on) as well as suitable to be treated in different visual layouts.</p>
		<p>Then we started to search the 9 articles (3 each of the three issues) strongly related within the same issue and at least quite related between the issues.</p>
		<p>In order to have to deal with cross reference also between languages, we planned to have a multilingual editorial plan with, for each issue, a main article and a book review in English, and a guest article in a different language - respectively Spanish, French and Italian. The "main" and the "guest" articles presents different visual features to be managed such as color or b/w photos or images, tables, boxes and special layout and so on. The "book review" article presents an easier layout.</p>
		<p>In terms of licences, we deliberately search for only open access contents with a maximum closure of CC-BY-SA-NC in order to be able to either give to the final user complete access to the original version and be allowed to do our project (avoiding then the ND not derivate clause).</p>

            <h2>DOCUMENTATION</h2>
<div>
	<h2>pre-1800</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: OTTAVIANO PETRUCCI and Early printings</h3>
	<p>For the ante quem 1800 style of our <em>Circus Magazine</em>, we decided to get inspired by the clean, elegant and essential graphics of some early examples of printed music in 16th-17th centuries. Mainly, we took as reference the work of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottaviano_Petrucci">Ottaviano Petrucci</a> (1466-1539), but also considered coeval printed books – e.g. by Aldo Manuzio – and traditional practices in the writing and printing of music around that time.</p>
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>The retrieval of a suitable font which could be at the same time readable as well as resembling the typography of 16th century was not easy. The choice fell on the <em>IM Fell Great Primer</em> font by <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/im-fell-great-primer-font.html">Igino Marini</a> which was used in both its normal as well as all its all capitals version (<em>IM Fell Great Primer SC</em>), as to simulate their combination and or alternation in early printed books for headings, authors, prose and poetry.</p>
	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	<p>As for it is for early printed books of music by Ottaviano Petrucci, such as the <em>Harmonice Musices Odhecaton</em> (ca. 1501), we limited our choice to a dark brown colour for ink-ish texts over the background image – set to the <code style="display: inline;">&lt;body&gt;</code> element as to resemble a unique sheet of paper. The only other colour present is the dark red with lighter red on mouse-over, inspired by ancient book’s rubricae, by decorated initials and by ancient sacred music – where musical notes where black over the four red lines staves.</p>
	<h3>LAYOUT and DETAILS</h3>
	<p>We decided to express as much as possible the essentiality and wide use of negative/white space, thus developing a quite simple and clean layout. For the Bibliographic References’ section, we customized the dotted list style by means of the rendered screenshot of a note in squared notation from the Odhecaton’s digitalization available at <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Harmonice_Musices_Odhecaton_(Petrucci,_Ottaviano)" title="Odhecaton - IMSLP">IMSLP</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>1801-1900</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: VER SACRUM</h3>
	<p>The XIX century cultural period style have been inspired by the late-century reference from Vienna Secession’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ver_Sacrum_(magazine)" target="_blank">Ver Sacrum</a> official magazine founded by Gustav Klimt and Max Kurzweil and published from 1898 to 1903. In particular, 1898 is inspired by the first 2 year issues (1898-1899) of the magazine.</p>	
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>Lacking a specific Viennese’s secession title font, the <a href="https://www.dafont.com/rivanna.font" target="_blank">Rivanna</a> art nuveau-inspired free font has been selected for titles and drop caps.</p>
	<p>For the rest of the body, we sought for a serif font with the typical “e” with a slanted horizontal bar, which matches the Jenson font family, which was originated by engraver and printer Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470. One of the modern revivals of the Jenson font was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Type" target="_blank">Golden Type</a> made by William Morris for the publication published by his Kelmscott Press. According to Daniel Verfasser Lawler (<cite href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=00495123&AN=150653371&h=Lg5ByU5N16uqAc70Z4vXUCpsK1JGCz6XdhOxTi8whBDtxzxJ%2FP6xDR6KXRreyugMRUaT8vWmb59rydaCPu1tYg%3D%3D&crl=c" target="_blank">Adolf Loos, William Morris, and the Golden Type." Umění 2020: 42</cite>), the Golden Type had a global success in the United States and in Europe. The font was widely used in Austria as well, and it was used both in Ver Sacrum, in the Journal of the Wiener Werkstätte, as well as in Adolf Loos' Das Andere. Several digital edition of Jenson's font are available, including Morris' font digitized by MIT. The font used is a free alternative downloadable from <a href="http://freakfonts.com/fonts/jenson-font-download.html" target="_blank">Freakfonts</a>.</p>
	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	<p>The main reference for this part have been the covers’ colors of <cite>Ver Sacrum</cite>, with a strong use of a bi-cromatic combinations of lighter and darker earth colors such as black, burnt sienna or pearl with brick-red, grey, green or sienna yellow:</p>

	<p>Internal pages counts on black writing on light background with some color decoration in table or images boxes:</p>

			</div>
	<div>
		<h2>1901-1950</h2>
		<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: MODERNISM</h3>
		<p>For this period we chose the <strong>Modernist movement</strong> as a reference. The movement had a deep influence not just on architectrure and design, but also on typografy leading to an innovative use of compositions of text and images and fonts.</p>
		<p>Our main published references have been the art journals <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/G" target="_blank">G Material zur elementaren Gestaltung</a></q>, <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/Sovremennaya_arkhitektura" target="_blank">Sovremennaya arkhitektura</a></q>, <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/File:Bauhaus_1-1_1926.jpg" target="_blank">Bauhaus</a></q> and <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/Veshch/Gegenstand/Objet" target="_blank">Veshch Gegenstand Objet</a></q>.
		
		<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
		<p>For the header and the general frame fonts we chose the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Staatliches">Staatliches</a> Google's font that, as declared from its source, <q>was designed in response to Herbert Bayer’s title lettering on the cover of the <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7567?artist_id=399&locale=en&page=1&sov_referrer=artist" alt="cover of Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy 'Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar 1919-1923'">first Bauhaus exhibition catalogue</a>, which was published in 1923</q>.</p>
		<p>For the article texts, we used <strong>Berthold Akzidenz-grotesk</strong> downloaded from <a href="https://freefontsvault.com/akzidenz-grotesk-font-download-free/">FreeFontsVault.com</a>. This font which was produced for the firts time in 1897 by Berthold type foundry, appears in some of the text from the first issue of the <q>Bauhaus</q> magazine. Akzidenz-grotesk was one of the first sans-serif fonts and it served as a basis for the development of Helvetica.</p> 
		<p>The line-height has been adjusted in order to better meet the dense typography of our examples.</p>

		<h3>LAYOUT and DETAILS</h3>
		<p>We have strongly played with the grid boxes and we adopted a <strong>3-vertical columns viewer</strong> in order to reproduce the complex organization of the selected examples.</p>	
		<p><strong>Black thick rows and lines</strong> isolating titles and references as well as the black background for the scrollbars has come from <q>Sovremennaya Architektura</q>. 
		<p><strong>Rounded black points</strong> to mark paragraph in the central-colum article have been inspired by Moholy-Nagy article layout in the Bauhaus journal.</p>
		<p>We took inspiration from our sources also to style the entities higlighting: when recalled by the metadataselector, they are indeed marked with a <strong>bigger font-size</strong>.</p>

	<h2>1950-1989</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: SAUL BASS</h3>
	<p>As representative for the cultural period 1950-1989, we decided to adopt as theme the work and aesthetic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass">Saul Bass</a> (1920-1996), the graphic designer known for his title sequences and movie posters design. A strong characterization in font, a peculiar use of colours, essential, clean, creative and neat delineation of graphical areas could be of great inspiration and example for web as well as for graphical designers.</p>
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>At first, browsing on the web for fonts resembling the Saul Bass typography, we found the <em>Hitchcock</em> font by <a href="https://typographica.org/on-typography/saul-bass-website-and-hitchcock-font-are-back/">Matt Terich</a>: this seemed to be the perfect solution for our purposes, but unfortunately it had to be discarded due to its copyright policy. We then thought about the 1001 fonts’ <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/doublebass-font.html"><em>Double Bass</em> font</a>, but this had indeed issues with the encoding of numbers, which weren’t readable indeed. 
	Thus, the choice fell on <em>Bassanova</em> by <a href="https://textfonts.net/bassanova-font.html">Julia Bausenhardt</a>, which seemed to be quite accurate as well as the previous ones, if not more. 
	We combined, throughout the <em>Issue Viewer</em>, different font sizes, decorations – e.g. using font-variant-ligatures: discretionary-ligatures – and an assorted use of colours as to express variety and to break the flow of words with highlighted and engaging keywords, bibliographical references and emphasised words, in line with the bold aesthetic of Saul Bass.</p>
	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	<p>For what concerns colour, the philosophy of Saul Bass seems to be quite straightforward: not many colours (generally 3 or 4 maximum), but vivid and striking. For our <em>Circus Magazine</em> theme, we decided to resemble as much as possible this ethos, but, of course, taking into consideration also the many layers of content available in the <em>Issue Viewer</em>. For these reasons we created a palette of the following colours and assigned them based on Saul Bass iconic title sequences or movie posters or on the semantics of our webpage – e.g. minor headings being lighter nuances of the intense colour of the major heading.</p>
	<h3>THE SKEW PROPERTY and DETAILS</h3>
	<p>In order to express the dynamic combination of areas of colours that intersect and overlay with plenty of diagonal lines instead of standards square angles, we decided to play with some content containers, such as the <code style="display: inline;">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements of the sections of the articles or the headings. By means of the css skew property, we applied a skew rotation to those elements on which this would not have resulted in a diminished readability for the web user. Some examples are the articles’s main headings, the section titles, the bibliographic references section. For this very last portion of the articles, the dotted list style was customized by means of the creation of an image from the star character with <em>Double Bass</em> font.</p>
