DoubleBass is a four weights display type family with a cartoon modern aesthetic, inspired by the film title design of Saul Bass. Its main feature is the programmed switching between two interlocking sets of uppercases resulting in a bouncy visual rhythm. DoubleBass looks great in logos and titling and covers +70 languages including Russian cyrillic.
